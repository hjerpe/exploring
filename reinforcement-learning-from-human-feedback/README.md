# Notebook Overview

This notebook is a detailed guide on implementing a reinforcement learning strategy using Vertex AI. It walks through the entire process of setting up a pipeline job, executing it, and evaluating the results. The notebook is structured to provide practical insights into each step of a reinforcement learning workflow, from data acquisition to the final analysis of model performance.

## Notebook Sections
1. **Get Data**
   This section focuses on acquiring and preparing the necessary data for the reinforcement learning model. It includes details on defining the data's location, ensuring the data is in the correct format for training, and setting up any data preprocessing steps required before model training.
2. **Run Pipeline Job**
   Here, the notebook guides through the configuration and execution of the Vertex AI pipeline job. It covers setting up the model, defining the training and evaluation parameters, and initiating the pipeline. The section ensures users understand how to manage and execute the pipeline effectively.
3. **Evaluate the Results**
   The final section delves into evaluating the model's performance post-training. It includes methods to visualize and interpret the results using tools like Tensorboard, compare the performance of tuned versus untuned models, and understand the metrics to assess the model's success in reinforcement learning tasks.
