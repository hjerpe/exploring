For example, here we are loading the camembert-base checkpoint in the fill-mask pipeline, which is completely fine. But if we were to load this checkpoint in the text-classification pipeline, the results would not make any sense because the head of camembert-base is not suitable for this task! We recommend using the task selector in the Hugging Face Hub interface in order to select the appropriate checkpoints:"
