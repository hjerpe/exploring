## Notebook Sections
1. **Overview of Embeddings-Based Retrieval**
   This section introduces embeddings-based retrieval, explaining the concept and its significance in the machine learning workflow. It sets the stage for understanding the various techniques and methods that will be discussed later in the notebook.
2. **Pitfalls of Retrieval and Query Expansion**
   Here, the notebook discusses the challenges and common pitfalls in simple vector search and introduces the concept of query expansion to overcome these issues. It includes methods and strategies for effectively expanding queries and improving retrieval results.
3. **Re-Ranking Strategies**
   This section delves into the concept of re-ranking, focusing on improving the long tail of search results and integrating query expansion into the re-ranking process. It discusses various approaches and techniques to enhance the relevance and accuracy of search results.
3. **Embedding Adaptors and Model Setup**
   The final section covers embedding adaptors and setting up the model. It guides you through creating datasets and configuring models, ensuring you understand how to prepare and execute your retrieval system effectively.
