# Notebook Overview

This notebook is a comprehensive compilation of various techniques and methods related to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and its applications. Each section focusing on specific aspects of RAG pipelines, metrics, and applications. The content is designed to provide a deep dive into the advanced methodologies and practical implementations of RAG systems.

## Notebook Sections

1. **Advanced RAG Pipeline**
Discusses the critical components of the RAG architecture, including the retriever, reader, and generator modules.

2. **RAG Triad of Metrics**
Introduces a tailored set of metrics for evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, focusing on their relevance and effectiveness. It explores each metric's application and delves into how they quantify RAG system performance, providing a concise yet comprehensive analysis."

3. **Sentence Window Retrieval**
Advanced retrieval techniques that enhance the performance of RAG systems by optimizing the sentence window selection process.

4. **Auto-merging Retrieval**
Strategies for dynamically merging retrieval results to improve the coherence and relevance of generated responses.
